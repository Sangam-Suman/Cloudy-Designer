# Cloudy-Designer
Project based on Spark AR to test idea for applying AR in the Fashion Technology domain.  


When we're trying to come up with a new idea, we all get a little foggy. 
It is very important for a designer to try it out to see how it will look before committing to a specific design. 
This method will also help designers check their design work in real time. 
Students can create a 3D model of their design here, and before picking up scissors and cloth, 
they can use augmentation to see how the design would fit aesthetically on a person's body.
Future application will be the Virtual Tryouts in various stores â€¦
